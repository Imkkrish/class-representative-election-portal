- **Admin Features**: The department can verify candidate details, and a password-protected results page allows for viewing the final vote count.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and includes dynamic components for a seamless experience.

This includes tables for users, candidates, votes, and election-related data. You can modify this file to add or alter tables as needed.

To initialize the database, simply run the `database.py` script:
